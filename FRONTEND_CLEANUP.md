# Frontend Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 Simplified Structure

This cleanup focuses the frontend on core MVP functionality:

### ✅ Kept (Essential)
- `/` - Simplified Dashboard with topic input
- `/mindmap` - Focused mindmap visualization page
- Core files: `layout.tsx`, `globals.css`, `favicon.ico`

### ❌ Removed (Too Complex for MVP)
- `/analytics` - Advanced feature for later
- `/paths` - Learning paths come after basic mindmap works  
- `/settings` - User settings after auth is implemented
- `/my-brain` - Confusing naming, replace with mindmap
- `/topics` - Will be integrated into mindmap workflow
- `/mindmaps` (plural) - Consolidate to single `/mindmap`

### 🎯 Benefits
1. **Clear Focus**: One input → One mindmap workflow
2. **Less Cognitive Load**: Only 2 main pages
3. **Faster Development**: Focus on core functionality first
4. **Better UX**: No confusing navigation

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Test the simplified navigation flow
2. Enhance the MindmapCanvas component
3. Add API integration for topics
4. Implement basic topic → mindmap functionality

### 🔄 Future Additions
Once core functionality works, we can gradually add back:
- Settings page (after authentication)
- Analytics dashboard (after data collection) 
- Learning paths (after topic relationships work)
- Advanced features (after user feedback)

This follows the principle: **Make it work, then make it better**.
